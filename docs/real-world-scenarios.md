## 🔧 `fixup` - Clean Up Your Commit History

### Scenario 1: Code Review Feedback
**The Problem:**
You submitted a pull request with this commit history:
```
abc123f Add user authentication system
def456g Add dashboard routing  
```

Your reviewer says: *"The auth system looks good, but you're missing input validation on the login form. Can you add that?"*

You add the validation and now need to incorporate it into the original auth commit.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Make your changes
git add login-form.js

# Create fixup commit manually
git commit --fixup=abc123f

# Interactive rebase to squash
git rebase -i --autosquash abc123f^
# Opens editor, you confirm the rebase plan, save and exit
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Make your changes  
git add login-form.js

# One command does it all
git x fixup abc123f --rebase
```

✅ **Result:** Your commit history stays clean, and the validation is properly incorporated into the auth commit.

---

### Scenario 2: Forgot to Add Tests
**The Problem:**
You just committed a new feature but realized you forgot to include the unit tests:

```
5a7b8c9 Add shopping cart functionality
```

You write the tests and want them to be part of the original feature commit, not a separate "add tests" commit.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
git add cart.test.js
git commit --fixup=5a7b8c9
git rebase -i --autosquash 5a7b8c9^
# Navigate the interactive rebase interface
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
git add cart.test.js
git x fixup 5a7b8c9 --rebase
```

✅ **Result:** Tests are included in the original feature commit, maintaining logical commit organization.

## 🏷️ `rename-branch` - Fix Branch Naming Mistakes

### Scenario 1: Typo in Branch Name
**The Problem:**
You created a branch for a user profile feature but made a typo:
```shell
git checkout -b user-proifle-page  # Oops! "proifle" instead of "profile"
```

You've made several commits and pushed to remote. Now you need to fix the typo everywhere.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Rename local branch
git branch -m user-proifle-page user-profile-page

# Delete old remote branch
git push origin :user-proifle-page

# Push new branch and set upstream
git push origin -u user-profile-page

# Update any PRs manually in GitHub/GitLab
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
git x rename-branch user-profile-page
```

✅ **Result:** Local branch renamed, remote updated, tracking fixed, all in one command.

---

### Scenario 2: Better Naming After Understanding Requirements
**The Problem:**
You started working on what you thought was a simple "login fix":
```
git checkout -b login-fix
```

After talking with the team, you realize this is actually a major authentication refactor that will take several days. The branch name no longer reflects the scope.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
git branch -m login-fix auth-system-refactor
git push origin :login-fix
git push origin -u auth-system-refactor
# Update PR title and description
# Notify team about branch name change
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
git x rename-branch auth-system-refactor
```

✅ **Result:** Branch name accurately reflects the work scope, easier for team collaboration.

## 📦 `stash-branch` - Manage Experimental Work

### Scenario 1: Interrupted by Urgent Bug Fix
**The Problem:**
You're halfway through implementing a complex feature when your manager says: *"Drop everything! Production is down, we need a hotfix for the payment system NOW!"*

You have uncommitted changes that aren't ready to commit, but you need to switch context immediately.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Stash your work
git stash push -m "WIP: new search algorithm - half implemented"

# Fix the urgent bug on master
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix-payment-bug
# ... fix the bug, commit, deploy ...

# Later, try to remember what you were doing
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{0}
# Hope you remember the context
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Stash and immediately create a proper branch for your work
git x stash-branch create search-algorithm-wip

# Handle the urgent fix
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix-payment-bug
# ... fix the bug ...

# Later, easily return to your feature work
git checkout search-algorithm-wip
# All your changes are there, properly organized
```

✅ **Result:** No lost work, clear context, proper branch organization.

---

### Scenario 2: Stash Cleanup After Team Sprint
**The Problem:**
After a busy sprint, your stash list looks like this:
```shell
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on feature-x: 2a3b4c5 Add validation
stash@{1}: On master: 1a2b3c4 Fix typo  
stash@{2}: WIP on feature-y: 9x8y7z6 Update styles
stash@{3}: On hotfix: 5d6e7f8 Debug logs
stash@{4}: WIP on feature-x: 3c4d5e6 Initial work
```

Most of these are outdated experiments or work that's been completed differently.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Manually inspect each stash
git stash show stash@{0}
git stash show stash@{1} 
# ... decide which ones to keep ...

# Manually drop old stashes
git stash drop stash@{1}
git stash drop stash@{3}
# Risk dropping the wrong ones
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Clean stashes older than 2 weeks
git x stash-branch clean --older-than 2w --dry-run
# Review what would be cleaned

git x stash-branch clean --older-than 2w
```

✅ **Result:** Clean workspace, no risk of accidentally losing recent work.

## ↶ `undo` - Fix Commit Mistakes

### Scenario 1: Committed Too Early
**The Problem:**
You're implementing OAuth integration and committed this:
```
git commit -m "Add OAuth integration"
```

Immediately after committing, you realize you forgot to:
- Add error handling for failed authentication
- Update the configuration documentation
- Add the new environment variables to `.env.example`

You want to include these in the same logical commit.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Undo the commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Make additional changes
# ... add error handling, docs, env vars ...
git add .

# Commit everything together
git commit -m "Add OAuth integration with error handling and docs"
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
git x undo

# Make additional changes
# ... add error handling, docs, env vars ...
git add .

git commit -m "Add OAuth integration with error handling and docs"
```

✅ **Result:** Clean, complete commit that includes all related changes.

---

### Scenario 2: Wrong Files Committed
**The Problem:**
You meant to commit just your feature changes, but accidentally included debug files:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add user preferences feature"
```

You realize the commit includes:
- `debug.log` (should be gitignored)
- `temp-test-data.json` (not meant for version control)
- Your actual feature files (these should stay)

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Undo the commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Unstage everything
git reset

# Carefully add only the files you want
git add src/preferences.js
git add src/preferences.test.js
git add docs/preferences.md

# Recommit
git commit -m "Add user preferences feature"

# Update .gitignore for future
echo "debug.log" >> .gitignore
echo "temp-test-data.json" >> .gitignore
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
git x undo

# Fix the staging
git reset
git add src/preferences.js src/preferences.test.js docs/preferences.md

# Commit properly
git commit -m "Add user preferences feature"
```

✅ **Result:** Clean commit with only the intended files.

## 🔗 `upstream` - Manage Remote Relationships

### Scenario 1: Fork Synchronization
**The Problem:**
You're contributing to an open-source project. You forked `original-repo/awesome-project` to `your-username/awesome-project`. After working on your feature for a week, the original repository has 15 new commits you need to sync.

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Add upstream remote (if not already done)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/awesome-project.git

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Check which branches need syncing
git branch -vv

# Sync master/main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Check if your feature branch needs updating
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase upstream/main

# Push updates
git push origin main
git push --force-with-lease origin your-feature-branch
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Set up upstream tracking for main branch
git checkout main
git x upstream set upstream/main

# Sync all branches that have upstream tracking
git x upstream sync-all

# Check status anytime
git x upstream status
```

✅ **Result:** All branches stay synchronized with minimal effort.

---

### Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Remote Workflow
**The Problem:**
Your team uses a complex Git workflow:
- `origin` = your fork
- `upstream` = main company repository  
- `staging` = staging environment repository

Different branches track different upstreams:
- `main` tracks `upstream/main`
- `feature-*` branches track `origin/main` 
- `staging` tracks `staging/main`

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# Manually track what's tracking what
git branch -vv

# Manually set up tracking for each branch
git checkout main
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main

git checkout staging  
git branch --set-upstream-to=staging/main

# Manually sync each branch
git checkout main
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main

git checkout staging
git fetch staging && git merge staging/main

# Easy to make mistakes or forget branches
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Set up tracking once
git checkout main
git x upstream set upstream/main

git checkout staging
git x upstream set staging/main

# View all upstream relationships
git x upstream status

# Sync everything at once
git x upstream sync-all --dry-run  # Preview changes
git x upstream sync-all             # Apply changes
```

✅ **Result:** Clear visibility and easy management of complex upstream relationships.

---

### Scenario 3: Team Onboarding
**The Problem:**
A new developer joins your team and needs to understand the repository's remote setup and get their local branches synchronized. The project has:
- Multiple feature branches
- Different remote tracking configurations
- Some branches that are behind their upstreams

**Traditional Git Approach:**
```shell
# New developer runs various commands to understand setup
git remote -v
git branch -vv
git log --oneline main..origin/main
git log --oneline feature-x..origin/feature-x

# Manually sync each branch
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout feature-x && git pull  
# Repeat for each branch...
```

**With git-x:**
```shell
# Instantly see the upstream status of everything
git x upstream status

# Sync all branches that need it
git x upstream sync-all
```

✅ **Result:** New team member quickly understands and synchronizes the entire repository state.
